# RaidSim
A text-based autobattler-type game in the terminal created for the Boot.dev First Personal Project course. Core game loop is building up of a party to fight a raid boss automatically, such that all choices happen outside of battle. Currently missing a few key features such as a data-driven agent AI, but technically has a playable game loop.
